<h1>Happy New Year 💖</h1>
<p>
Dear Bianca Jaz L. Buenaobra, to my most precious girl in the world.

I wanted to leave this here. Not just a message, not just words—but a promise, a declaration, a piece of my heart written down so time can never take it away.

As this new year begins, I want you to know something very clearly:
I choose you. Again. Still. Always.

I choose you in the quiet moments when the world is asleep.
I choose you in the loud ones, when life feels overwhelming.
I choose you on the easy days, and even more on the difficult ones.

You are not a chapter in my life.
You are the story.

This year—and every year after—I don’t wish for perfect days. I wish for days with you. Days where your laugh exists somewhere in the background of my life. Days where your name still feels like home on my tongue. Days where loving you continues to feel like the most natural thing I’ve ever done.

Bianca, loving you has changed the way I see everything.
It taught me patience.
It taught me tenderness.
It taught me that love isn’t loud all the time—it’s steady, it’s intentional, it stays.

You are the softness I didn’t know I needed and the strength I admire more than I can explain. You are kind in ways that don’t ask for recognition. Beautiful in ways that go far beyond what the eyes can see. Your presence alone makes the world feel safer, warmer, more alive.

I don’t love you just for who you are on your best days.
I love you for who you are on the quiet ones, the tired ones, the days you doubt yourself even though you shouldn’t.
I love every version of you—the joyful one, the thoughtful one, the vulnerable one, the one still becoming.

As this new year begins, here is my vow to you:

I vow to choose you even when it’s hard.
To listen, not just hear.
To protect your heart, not just hold your hand.
To grow with you, not ahead of you, not away from you.

I vow to be someone you can rest in.
Someone who prays for you when you’re strong and especially when you’re not.
Someone who never stops learning how to love you better.

when this year officially begins, I want you to know this:

You are my greatest blessing.
You are my answered prayer in human form.
You are the person I see in my tomorrows, not out of habit, but out of hope.

No matter what this year brings—joy, challenges, growth, change—I promise this: my love for you will not be seasonal. It will not depend on circumstances. It will not expire with time.

I am here.
I am staying.
I am choosing you—this year, and every year that follows.

Happy New Year, my most precious princess in the world.
May this year be gentle with you.
And may you always know, without doubt, that you are deeply, intentionally, and endlessly loved—by me.

Will always be yours, Your Oldie.

<!-- POEM -->
<div class="section" id="poem">
<h1>For Bianca Jaz L. Buenaobra, My greatest blessing.</h1>
<p>
In the quiet before midnight, I speak your name—
Bianca—soft as a prayer, bright as a flame.
You are the echo my heart has been chasing,
The calm in my chaos, the warmth I am embracing.

I remember how your laughter lingers like sunlight,
Filling every shadow, turning darkness to light.
How your kindness stretches beyond what eyes can see,
A soul so gentle, yet fierce, it captivates me.

You are the melody that hums in my chest,
The whispered secret I carry, the one I love best.
In your eyes, I see stories that words cannot hold,
A universe of wonder, of courage, of gold.

I love the way your heart beats quietly yet true,
The little things you do, the things only I knew.
The way you care, the way you dream, the way you stay,
The way you turn ordinary moments into a ballet.

Bianca, I love you when the world feels unfair,
When burdens weigh heavy and life does not care.
I love you when you doubt yourself, when you’re unsure,
Because even then, your soul is pure, my love, so pure.

I vow to be your shelter, your laughter, your home,
To walk beside you, no matter where we roam.
I vow to see every scar, every joy, every tear,
And love you more with each passing year.

You are the prayer I didn’t know how to say,
The heartbeat that steadies me, that guides me each day.
With every glance, every smile, every gentle touch,
You remind me why loving you is never too much.

So here, in this moment, under the turning sky,
I offer my heart, my soul, my every why.
Bianca, you are my forever, my always, my now,
And I will love you endlessly—I vow.

No storm can shake it, no shadow can dim,
This fire that burns because of you within.
Every tomorrow I wake, every breath that I take,
It is yours, my Bianca, for your love’s sake.

And if tears ever fall, let them be of delight,
Of knowing this love was always meant to write
A story of two hearts, entwined, unbroken,
A language of love that needs no spoken token.

So cry, laugh, dream, and remember this true—
Bianca, my world begins and ends with you.

<!-- RESOLUTION -->
<div class="section" id="resolution">
<h1>Your Oldie 2026 Resolution</h1>
<p>
Hey my most beautiful and dearest girl in the world, I want to tell you something. Something I’m deciding for this new year, something I want you to know because you are part of every beat of my heart.

This year, I resolve to become closer to God than ever before.
To let Him mold me into the man He wants me to be—strong, patient, faithful, and loving… the kind of man worthy of walking beside you, the kind who lifts you up even when you don’t notice.

I resolve to pray more, not just for me, but for us.
To seek His guidance in every choice, every step, every dream… so that my life becomes a reflection of His love, and maybe… just maybe… I can love you the way He intends me to, perfectly yet humbly, every single day.

And Bianca… oh, this one is just for you.
I resolve to fall in love with you again and again.
To notice the way your eyes light up when you laugh.
To memorize every little detail, every habit, every word you say.
To never take for granted that I get to call you mine.

I resolve to make this love more than just feelings—
To make it a safe place, a home, a heaven you can visit in the middle of life’s chaos.
To make you feel seen, cherished, and adored…
Because loving you is not just a choice, it’s my honor, my joy, my privilege.

So in 2026, I’m committing to grow.
To grow in God, to grow in love, to grow into the man He wants me to be for you.
And every step I take, every prayer I whisper, every beat of my heart, will be for us.

Bianca… this is my promise.
This is my resolution.
And I can’t wait to live it with you, to fall for you again, and again, and again…
Because you are my greatest blessing, my answered prayer, my forever.

So, here’s to 2026. Here’s to God shaping me, to love deepening, and to us... always us.
