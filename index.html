Bianca,

If you’re reading this, then the year has already changed.
The clock has crossed midnight, and somehow, everything feels new—yet you are still the same miracle I woke up loving yesterday.

Before the fireworks faded, before the noise took over, I wanted to leave this here. Not just a message, not just words—but a promise, a declaration, a piece of my heart written down so time can never take it away.

As this new year begins, I want you to know something very clearly:
I choose you. Again. Still. Always.

I choose you in the quiet moments when the world is asleep.
I choose you in the loud ones, when life feels overwhelming.
I choose you on the easy days, and even more on the difficult ones.

You are not a chapter in my life.
You are the story.

This year—and every year after—I don’t wish for perfect days. I wish for days with you. Days where your laugh exists somewhere in the background of my life. Days where your name still feels like home on my tongue. Days where loving you continues to feel like the most natural thing I’ve ever done.

Bianca, loving you has changed the way I see everything.
It taught me patience.
It taught me tenderness.
It taught me that love isn’t loud all the time—it’s steady, it’s intentional, it stays.

You are the softness I didn’t know I needed and the strength I admire more than I can explain. You are kind in ways that don’t ask for recognition. Beautiful in ways that go far beyond what the eyes can see. Your presence alone makes the world feel safer, warmer, more alive.

I don’t love you just for who you are on your best days.
I love you for who you are on the quiet ones, the tired ones, the days you doubt yourself even though you shouldn’t.
I love every version of you—the joyful one, the thoughtful one, the vulnerable one, the one still becoming.

As this new year begins, here is my vow to you:

I vow to choose you even when it’s hard.
To listen, not just hear.
To protect your heart, not just hold your hand.
To grow with you, not ahead of you, not away from you.

I vow to be someone you can rest in.
Someone who prays for you when you’re strong and especially when you’re not.
Someone who never stops learning how to love you better.

If God allows it—if it is His will—then I pray that this year brings us closer, deeper, stronger. Not just in love, but in faith, in understanding, in purpose. I don’t ask for a perfect future. I ask for a shared one.

At midnight, when this year officially begins, I want you to know this:

You are my greatest blessing.
You are my answered prayer in human form.
You are the person I see in my tomorrows, not out of habit, but out of hope.

No matter what this year brings—joy, challenges, growth, change—I promise this: my love for you will not be seasonal. It will not depend on circumstances. It will not expire with time.

I am here.
I am staying.
I am choosing you—this year, and every year that follows.

Happy New Year, my Bianca.
May this year be gentle with you.
And may you always know, without doubt, that you are deeply, intentionally, and endlessly loved—by me.

Always.
  </p>

      I don’t always know how to say things out loud.<br><br>

      Every word here is something I’ve carried quietly,
      something I wanted you to know without rushing time.
